## Ashby-Specific Patterns

| Pattern | Approach | Source |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Arbitration/certification checkboxes | Click `label` element (not input) — label clicks trigger React checkbox | OpenAI Ashby |
| Toggle Yes/No (Ashby) | Use `page.evaluate()` to find container by label text + click button inside | All Ashby |
| Combobox location (Ashby) | `input[role="combobox"]` — fill + waitForTimeout(900) + click first option | All Ashby |
| College/university field | Use `document.querySelector('label[for="${id}"]')` to find by label[for] | Decagon |
| Breezy HR (AngularJS) forms | Use `angular.element(el).triggerHandler('input')` + `scope.$apply()` — NOT standard DOM events or Playwright .fill() | ShipScience |
